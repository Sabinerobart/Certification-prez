# Certification presentation

- This website is a presentation support for my Web Dev certification.
  All data is imported from a database. All visitors can view all pages ; the admin has the advantage of being able to update the content directly on the website

- A logged in user can see his own data displayed on the Website (for now, only his name and the date when he was a student a @WildCodeSchool)

- I am thinking of letting the logged in user update his own content for a true template presentation website
